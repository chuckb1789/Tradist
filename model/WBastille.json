For the first crux (10d), underclinging left under a roof there are a few so-so cams to be placed in an uneven crack.  For the second crux (10d, or easier), you have a bolt just below you.  Some say this is S, but the bolt is not far away.  The face above is certainly runout, but the grade is closer to 5.8 by the time you are far from the bolts.  The route could produce some real thumper falls, and someone could get hurt.  This route should not be taken lightly.smallest TCU's at the first set of  overlaps and then a #3 Camalot"
